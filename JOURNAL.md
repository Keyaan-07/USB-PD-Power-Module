Today i will be finding the USB PD negotiation IC. So basically i have the idea of making the smallest(that i can create) power module to power my electronics projects,
when i am prototyping.

okay, found the IC, it is [AP33772SDKZ-13-FA01](https://www.mouser.in/ProductDetail/Diodes-Incorporated/AP33772SDKZ-13-FA01?qs=2wMNvWM5ZX4CLYQ4%252BLyimw%3D%3D), and now i have another idea, let's make a variable power supply, which gives variable power supply if PPS is available, or else it gives constant supply @ 5V, 9V, 12V, 15V or 20V.

i think i am gonna use some microcontroller (probably an rp2040) along with an OLED that displays voltage and current, and also rotary encoders/potentiometers, although i haven't decided on that.
